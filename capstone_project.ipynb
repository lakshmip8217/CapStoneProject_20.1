He’s a bad guy, with major character flaws. He’s also very weak and insecure, and will do and say anything for publicity. He was a staunch supporter of Crooked Hillary Clinton during her failed Campaign for President, and is now a supporter of Lyin’ Kamala Harris, but that’s only because I don’t take his many phone calls anymore - Just don’t have the time or inclination to do so.

CEASE & DESIST: I, together with many Attorneys and Legal Scholars, am watching the Sanctity of the 2024 Presidential Election very closely because I know, better than most, the rampant Cheating and Skullduggery that has taken place by the Democrats in the 2020 Presidential Election. It was a Disgrace to our Nation! Therefore, the 2024 Election, where Votes have just started being cast, will be under the closest professional scrutiny and, WHEN I WIN, those people that CHEATED will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law, which will include long term prison sentences so that this Depravity of Justice does not happen again. We cannot let our Country further devolve into a Third World Nation, AND WE WON’T! Please beware that this legal exposure extends to Lawyers, Political Operatives, Donors, Illegal Voters, & Corrupt Election Officials. Those involved in unscrupulous behavior will be sought out, caught, and prosecuted at levels, unfortunately, never seen before in our Country.\n",

This is a totally unacceptable travesty, and Governor Youngkin is absolutely right to appeal this ILLEGAL ORDER, and the U.S. Supreme Court will hopefully fix it! Only U.S. Citizens should be allowed to vote. Keep fighting, Glenn - AND REPUBLICANS IN VIRGINIA, KEEP VOTING EARLY!

Kamala again made a fool of herself last night at a Radical Left fundraiser, and this after putting on a very Low IQ display at a FAKE NEWS CNN Town Hall. She was almost incoherent, and even host Allison Cooper, who couldn’t get her to make any sense, became agitated. Kamala is DEMANDING LATE TERM ABORTION, in months 7, 8, and 9, and even execution after birth, and people aren’t buying it - and they never will. She is a Radical Left Lunatic!\n",

It is so bad for winning the Most Important Election in the History of our Country. Likewise, not a moment goes by when I’m not looking at negative, false Ads that the other camp stuffs the Fox airwaves with.

The reason she wants it now is simple, she is losing in the Polls, and is desperate - Will do anything! The problem is that Kamala can’t even do a simple Interview, and needs the Fake News Broadcasters, like CBS, to completely withdraw her answer on 60 Minutes, which was INCOHERENT, and illegally insert a completely different one in order to make her look modestly “intelligent.” IT DIDN’T HELP, AND 60 MINUTES WILL BE PAYING A HEAVY PRICE FOR A LONG TIME TO COME…\n",

According to her Doctor’s Report, she suffers from “urticaria,” defined as “a rash of round, red welts on the skin that itch intensely, sometimes with dangerous swelling.” She also has “allergic rhinitis and allergic conjunctivitis,” a very messy and dangerous situation. These are deeply serious conditions that clearly impact her functioning. Maybe that is why she can’t answer even the simplest of questions asked by 60 Minutes, and others. What is this all about? I don’t have these problems…\n",

Sams is just a below average guy, with memorized FAKE NEWS soundbites, almost all of which are WRONG, but coupled with all of the other Harris Radical Left Democrat mouthpieces that Fox puts on (Richard Fowler, Patrick Murphy, “something” Wolf, Jessica Tarloff?), it has a very negative effect on the Election. Think of it, I spend an hour with the wonderful Maria Bartiromo, do a beautiful job, and then am followed up all day long by one-sided, negative Democrats, including Ian Sams, who virtually owns the Network.

Vitally, the Supreme Court’s Historic Fischer and Immunity Decisions, and the DOJ’s Ironclad 60 day “No Election Interference” Rule, require that the D.C.

      "817. Judge Jeanine Pirro: “There's no question that the Department of Justice has had regulations over the years that say - Whenever there is an Election on a State or National level, you do not release, Number One, an investigation, an Indictment, anything that may impact the Election…This is definitely Election Interference—There's nothing new in this.

      "818. Andrew McCarthy: “The point of this was to try to get this information, which has been hashed out again and again before the American people. None of this is new, but the idea was to get the evidence out in a spectacular way as possible. The point of releasing this now can only be to affect the Election. There's no legal need for it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "819. Jonathan Turley: “The Supreme Court handed down a major ruling on Presidential Immunity….That's the real question here of why Judge Chutkan, who has said that she will not consider the Election in her decisions, but why she still saw this as the right time to release this…For many, this is sort of a gratuitous act. You don't have to release this before the Election.”\n",
      "\n",
      "820. Elie Honig, Chief Legal Analyst, CNN: “First, this is backward. The way motions work — under the federal rules, and consistent with common sense — is that the prosecutor files an indictment; the defense makes motions (to dismiss charges, to suppress evidence, or what have you); and then the prosecution responds to those motions. Makes sense, right? It’s worked for hundreds of years in our courts. Not here. Not when there’s an election right around the corner and dwindling opportunity to make a dent. So Smith turned the well-established, thoroughly uncontroversial rules of criminal procedure on their head and asked Judge Chutkan for permission to file first — even with no actual defense motion pending. Trump’s team objected, and the judge acknowledged that Smith’s request to file first was ‘procedurally irregular’ — moments before she ruled in Smith’s favor, as she’s done at virtually every consequential turn….\n",
      "\n",
      "821. ….Which brings us to the second point: Smith’s proactive filing is prejudicial to Trump, legally and politically. It’s ironic. Smith has complained throughout the case that Trump’s words might taint the jury pool. Accordingly, the special counsel requested a gag order that was so preposterously broad that even Judge Chutkan slimmed it down considerably (and the Court of Appeals narrowed it further after that). Yet Smith now uses grand-jury testimony (which ordinarily remains secret at this stage) and drafts up a tidy 165-page document that contains all manner of damaging statements about a criminal defendant, made outside of a trial setting and without being subjected to the rules of evidence or cross-examination, and files it publicly, generating national headlines.”\n",
      "\n",
      "822. Elie Honig, Chief Legal Analyst, CNN: “Smith’s conduct here violates core DOJ principle and policy. The Justice Manual — DOJ’s internal bible, essentially — contains a section titled “Actions That May Have an Impact on the Election.” Now: Does Smith’s filing qualify? May it have an impact on the election? Of course. So what does the rule tell us? “Federal prosecutors … may never select the timing of any action, including investigative steps, criminal charges, or statements, for the purpose of affecting any election.” Remember, Smith begged the judge to flip the rules on their head so he could file this document first, and quickly — “any action,” by any reasonable definition — with the election right around the corner….\n",
      "\n",
      "823. ….I’m going to hand this one over to one of DOJ’s most esteemed alums, who explained it this way to the Justice Department’s internal watchdog: ‘To me if it [an election] were 90 days off, and you think it has a significant chance of impacting an election, unless there’s a reason you need to take that action now, you don’t do it.’ Those words were spoken by Sally Yates — former deputy attorney general, venerated career prosecutor, no fan of Trump (who unceremoniously fired her in 2017), and liberal folk hero. As usual, Yates is spot on. And her explanation conveys this indelible truth: If prosecutors bend their principles depending on the identity of their prey, then they’ve got no principles at all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "824. Gregg Jarrett: “Releasing this motion, this court filing, it sure looks like blatant Election Interference…There's no good reason to make it public. It's premature. There isn't even a trial date. So, I think this was done knowing full well Media and Democrats would seize on ‘provocative’ details, publicize it, to affect voters…At times it reads like bad detective fiction. A lot of it is irrelevant and inadmissible conversations that other people have that are not connected to Trump directly. So, it seems like deliberate Election Interference…The problem for Smith is a lot of his evidence and testimony comes from Public Officials, and their conversations with Trump, including the Vice President. Under the Supreme Court Decision that may well be protected information, and thus inadmissible.”\n",
      "\n",
      "825. Jonathan Turley: “Smith was clearly eager to get this out before the public despite Justice Department policies that encourage prosecutors to avoid acts that would be viewed as trying to influence an election. He is trying to thread the needle in this filing to get around the Supreme Court immunity decision…The new case is to indictments what shrinkflation is to products -- same package just less content. Smith knows that he has a motivated and supportive judge and wants to simply prove the same basic claims on less evidence.”\n",

It would have been better, and far less expensive, for everyone! Unfortunately, a Democrat turned Republican(?) State Senator named Mike McDonnell decided, for no reason whatsoever, to get in the way of a great Republican, common sense, victory. Just another “Grandstander!” Who knows, perhaps one of the others two Republicans that were a “NO” Vote will change their minds. In the meantime, thank you to Governor Pillen and Omaha Mayor Jean Stothert (“I always preferred a winner take all allocation of Nebraska’s Electoral Votes!) for their hard work and effort.

Dolan. We know the Spirit of Al Smith, the first Catholic Nominee of a Major Party, and John F. Kennedy, the FIRST Catholic President, will be in the room with us that night. It was a virtual event in 2020, and I was delighted to speak to our Catholic friends that day and, of course, it was a HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL evening in 2016 when we were there in person with Crooked Hillary Clinton. The reviews of my remarks were TREMENDOUS. It’s sad, but not surprising, that Kamala has decided not to attend. I don’t know what she has against our Catholic friends, but it must be a lot, because she certainly hasn’t been very nice to them, in fact, Catholics are literally being persecuted by this Administration. Any Catholic that votes for Comrade Kamala Harris should have their head examined….\n",

Also, who can forget the flagrant, in-your-face “TRANSGENDER DAY OF VISIBILITY” Kamala and Biden hosted at the White House on Easter Sunday (of all days!). Regardless, I will see everyone on October 17th, and we will have a GREAT night for Catholic Charities. It’s sad that Kamala doesn’t care about these good works, but with her History of anti-Catholic actions, she would have a hard time anyway!\n",

When I watched her interview yesterday with a woman who is destroying, through her complete and total incompetence, America, I couldn’t help but think this isn’t the real Oprah, this isn’t a person that wants millions of people, from prisons and mental institutions, and terrorists, drug dealers, and human traffickers, from all over the World, pouring into our Country. Kamala looked really foolish, couldn’t answer the simplest of questions on Inflation, the Cost of Goods, or our very porous and dangerous Border - No leader there, and Oprah just wanted to crawl under a table!

This week he had “dumb as a rock” bimbo Stephanie Ruhle, from MSDNC, on the show, along with a Trump hating loser, Bret Stephens, who seemed totally confused and unsure of himself, very much like Maher himself. Steven’s should find himself another line of work because I am driving the FAILING New York Times absolutely crazy, and it is very hard, perhaps impossible, for a writer to write well of me without suffering the wrath of the degenerate editors who, with a push from the top, have gone insane.

      "1502. This is what various Legal Scholars and Experts, Brilliant Lawyers, and Highly Respected Journalists think of the Manhattan D.A. Hoax, where the Democrats, headed up by Comrade Kamala Harris, working directly with the DOJ (which they’re not supposed to be!), want to put a Former President of the United States, and the Leading Candidate for President, in PRISON. This is unheard of, there has never been anything like it in our Country, and they are doing it in a blatant and illegal attempt to “win” an Election that, based on their results, should be “unwinnable,” but I can’t talk about it because Judge Merchan has put an UnConstitutional Gag Order on me. Somehow it will ALL work out - I don’t know how, I don’t know why, I don’t know when, but it always does!\n",
      "\n",
      "1503. Andrew C. McCarthy: “Merchan must vacate the guilty verdicts because of the Court’s decision in Trump v. United States, which holds that presidents are immune from criminal prosecution based on their official acts.” Jonathan Turley: “I believe Trump verdict will be 'reversed.’” David Rivkin, Jr. and Elizabeth Price Foley: “Trump’s Trial Violated Due Process: He was denied notice of the charges, meaningful opportunity to respond, and proof of all elements… The Constitution demands that higher courts throw out the verdict against him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "1504. Steven Calabresi: “President Donald Trump's First Amendment freedom of speech rights render his recent convictions in a Manhattan New York State trial court unconstitutional.” Mike Davis: “It’s an election-year assault on the Democrat Party’s number-one enemy.” Former Acting U.S. Attorney General Matthew Whitaker: “We must stand against the Weaponization of Justice in Courts around this Country. This can never happen again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "1505. Mark Levin: “No crime, no jurisdiction, no due process, conflicted judge, Soros prosecutor, Manhattan jury.” Elie Honig: “No state prosecutor — in New York, or Wyoming, or anywhere — has ever charged federal election laws as a direct or predicate state crime, against anyone, for anything. None. Ever.” Gregg Jarrett: “It’s a persecution, not a prosecution of any legitimacy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "1506. Andrew Cherkasky: “Democrats want to see Trump prosecuted for their own lawfare benefit.” Leo Terrell: “It’s all politics. If anyone tells you otherwise, they are not a lawyer.” Alan Dershowitz: “I have observed and participated in trials throughout the world. I have seen justice and injustice in China, Russia, Ukraine, England, France, Italy, Israel, as well as in nearly 40 of our 50 states. But in my 60 years as a lawyer and law professor, I have never seen a spectacle such as the one I observed sitting in the front row of the courthouse.” Bill O’Reilly: “The State of New York's image as a place of freedom and fairness is in tatters. There is no justice in New York…There is no question New York ranks up there with Venezuela and Cuba.”\n",
      "\n",
      "1507. Rich Lowry: “The charges were rigged, the prosecution’s presentation of the case was rigged, the judge’s management of the case was rigged, the gag order was rigged, and the instructions to the jury were rigged. The whole thing was rigged from beginning to end, in the hopes of — to the extent this case and the guilty verdict will matter in November — rigging the presidential election. If this had happened in an alderman race in Cook County, Ill., it’d be discomfiting enough, but it happened in what purports to be the greatest city in the world and involves the campaign to become the most powerful political leader in the free world.” Democrat Pollsters Doug Schoen and Carly Cooperman: “Our finding that large pluralities or outright majorities of Americans perceive these indictments as politically motivated should be a warning sign to Democrats.”\n",

Why aren’t they looking into Iran, China, & other Countries and, more importantly, why aren’t they looking at Marc Elias, Mark Pomerantz, the relationship between Lisa Monaco to Andrew Weissmann, CREW, and all of the other Enemies of the People that had such an effect on the 2020 Election, and are trying to Rig and Steal the 2024 Presidential Election.

Americans are getting slaughtered overseas, while Kamala is disparaging and making up lies about Gold Star families, and Biden is sleeping on the beach on this 16th consecutive day of vacation. They have blood on their hands! Sadly, this is the total lack of “Leadership” that Kamala and Biden represent - One that allows terrorists to take American lives, because they only care about Weaponizing the Department of Justice against their Political Opponent. Just like the Debacle of the Afghanistan Withdrawal that claimed 13 American lives, Kamala and Biden’s judgment has not only put lives at risk, but is directly responsible for unnecessary deaths that should have never happened….\n",

In Afghanistan, you don’t take the Soldiers out first, you take the Soldiers out last.

Today marks the 3-year anniversary of the terrorist attack at Abbey Gate that left 13 American servicemembers dead, dozens more badly wounded, with many innocent civilians also killed and injured.

The Debate was previously scheduled against Sleepy Joe Biden on ABC, but has been terminated in that Biden will no longer be a participant, and I am in litigation against ABC Network and George Slopadopoulos, thereby creating a conflict of interest. The FoxNews Debate will be held in the Great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, at a site in an area to be determined.

I spent Hundreds of Millions of Dollars, Time, and Effort fighting Joe, and when I won the Debate, they threw a new Candidate into the ring. Not fair, but it is what it is! Nevertheless, different Candidate or not, their bad Policies are the same, and this will be strongly revealed at the September 4th Debate.

Brown emigrated to Jamaica when it was a British colony, and once he arrived, he became an  avid slave owner on the sugar plantations in Jamaica.Hamilton Brown opposed the abolition of slavery in the British Empire and promoted slavery and slave ownership till the day he died.

Just yesterday, it was reported that more than 1,000 members of the savage Venezuelan Gang “Tren de Aragua” are plotting to conduct ambush attacks on police and law enforcement in the United States—all while Harris and Biden sit in the White House and try to figure out who is dumber.On Sunday, in a separate incident, a Venezuelan illegal alien criminal let in by Border Czar Harris shot a female police officer in Texas multiple times with a rifle—thankfully, the officer is expected to survive, but many victims are not so lucky. In Texas last month, 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray was tied up, sexually assaulted, and strangled to death by two illegal aliens who Biden and Harris released into the United States.If Border Czar Harris stays in charge, every single week will bring a never-ending stream of illegal alien rapists, bloodthirsty killers, and child predators to go after our sons and daughters.\n",

He stood strong in the face of vicious attacks and gotcha questions, because that’s what leaders do.  As for his record, President Trump accomplished MORE for the Black Community than any other President in my lifetime.  FULL STOP. He’s responsible for the First Step Act (real criminal justice reform), historic funding of HBCUs (just like the one my parents attended), created opportunity zones, funded workforce development, was a CHAMPION for school choice, and delivered the greatest economy of our lifetime for Americans of ALL color.

With time, this situation will only get worse for our Country. It must galvanize the Republican Party, Democrats, Independents, Conservatives, Progressives, Libertarians, and everybody else to put STRENGTH, RESPECT, AND POWER back into the U.S.A. This Attack, just like the Attack of October 7th, or the Ukraine/Russia War, would have never happened if I were President!

We will FEAR NOT, but instead remain resilient in our Faith and Defiant in the face of Wickedness. Our love goes out to the other victims and their families.

Most importantly, I want to extend my condolences to the family of the person at the Rally who was killed, and also to the family of another person that was badly injured. It is incredible that such an act can take place in our Country. Nothing is known at this time about the shooter, who is now dead. I was shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear. I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin. Much bleeding took place, so I realized then what was happening. GOD BLESS AMERICA!\n",

No other President did anything about these long term delinquencies. The Secretary General of NATO said it was “incredible” what “President Trump had done.” It made NATO viable again.

It violates your First Amendment rights and mine as well. The First Amendment, as interpreted by the Supreme Court, provides that no government agency can abridge the freedom of speech. This important freedom has two parts. The first is the right of the speaker to express his views. The second, less obvious but equally important, is the right of the public to hear the speaker’s views and evaluate them. Justice Thurgood Marshall summarized Supreme Court case law on this subject in Stanley v. Georgia (1969): ‘It is now well established that the Constitution protects the right to receive information and ideas’…Just as no one is above the law, no one is above criticism regarding the legal process. In the marketplace of ideas protected by the First Amendment, all of us—not the New York courts—have a right to judge him on what he says.”….\n",
      "\n",
      "2740. ….“It is important to remember that a gag order is a prior restraint on speech. The First Amendment prohibits prior restraints except in the most extraordinary circumstances, in which important countervailing interests are at stake. In New York Times Co. v. U.S. (1971), the Pentagon Papers case, the Supreme Court rejected such claims by the government and allowed the media to publish sensitive classified information…The marketplace of ideas shouldn’t allow one candidate to take unfair advantage of a questionable conviction while the other candidate has one hand tied behind his back by a questionable gag order. Voters who haven’t yet made up their minds, and who might be influenced by what both Messrs. Biden and Trump have to say about the fairness of the conviction, should consider filing friend-of-the-court briefs so that the justices can consider their interests as well as Mr. Trump’s…The politicization of the courts poses a threat to due process and the rule of law.”\n",

It’s weird, and also, that’s our job. Nevertheless, the Bee is correct. So, regrettably, was President Trump himself when he said that ‘Mother Theresa couldn’t beat these charges.’….\n",
      "\n",
      "2772. ….“This is not because the charges were persuasive; they weren’t. This is not because the evidence presented was damning; if anything, it was damning for the prosecution who staked their case on a convicted perjurer’s word and sent a porn star who mistook a possum for a ghost to testify, even though she had no knowledge that was pertinent and contradicted her own public interviews in her testimony. The reason this case was rigged was simple: because this trial was less an American trial and more like a real-life repeat of the infamous Disney cartoon ‘Pluto’s Judgment Day,’ in which the titular dog dreams of being sent to Hell, where he is tried by a courtroom full of cats. Except that cats would probably give dogs a fairer hearing than this jury and (especially) this Judge gave Trump….\n",
      "\n",
      "2773. ….“However, unlike the prosecutors in this case, we will not simply lob a charge and then expect friendly audiences to accept it unquestioningly. Unlike the prosecutors, we plan to prove our case; at least, as much as we can in an editorial. The evidence is so exhaustive it could fill a book. But we will try to summarize it as far as possible. Start with Judge Juan Merchan’s infamous ‘gag order,’ a blatant and arguably unconstitutional attack on President Trump’s free speech rights, and which Trump is suing Merchan over…In the course of the trial, Merchan has denied Trump the right to attend a Supreme Court hearing on his claims of presidential immunity and even initially denied him the right to attend his own son’s high school graduation. Gratuitous and nasty though these decisions were, however, they pale in comparison to Merchan’s more substantively dangerous rulings….\n",
      "\n",
      "2774. ….“For example, as Jonathan Turley argued, Merchan ‘continues to allow the jury to hear references to campaign-finance violations that do not exist.’ He refused to allow a legal expert to testify that these violations did not exist…He sustained every prosecutorial objection to defense witness Robert Costello repeatedly pointing out Michael Cohen’s record as a perjurer, and then screamed at Costello from the bench when he expressed his frustration and befuddlement. Costello, for the record, is both a former prosecutor and a far more decorated lawyer than Cohen, yet Merchan treated him with about as much respect as a convicted felon….\n",
      "\n",
      "2775. ….“Then, when prosecutors showed similar disregard for his own rulings in their closing arguments, Merchan simply let it slide. But none of this, none of this can hold a candle to Merchan’s instructions to the jury before they began deliberations. Firstly, Merchan told the jury they did not have to agree on what crime Trump committed (or, indeed, whether he committed a crime at all). Even if four jurors believed Trump had committed one crime, four believed he had committed a second (but not the first), and four believed he committed a third (but not the first two), Merchan would treat that as a unanimous verdict. In other words, the jury were allowed to act like South Park’s underpants gnomes, and convict Trump under the following theory:Point 1: Trump falsified his business records to commit a crime (specified in point 2)Point 2: ?????????????Point 3: GUILTY!….\n",
      "\n",
      "2776. ….“Secondly, Merchan declined to instruct the jury on what campaign finance law actually says, because what it actually says is that Trump’s actions did not constitute a campaign finance violation. This, after Merchan blocked the aforementioned defense witness, a former chair of the Federal Election Commission, from testifying that Trump’s actions did not fall afoul of campaign finance law for the simple reason that any reporting of the expense in question would have to take place after the election. In other words, it would have to be a conspiracy to influence the election, which somehow existed after the election already took place. Yeah, okay….\n",
      "\n",
      "2777. ….“Thirdly, Merchan allowed the prosecution to charge Trump with a misdemeanor crime which has long been considered dead due to its vague character. Fourthly, Merchan allowed the jury to convict Trump not because he specifically intended to defraud anyone, but rather because of a ‘general intent’ to defraud ‘any person or entity.’ In other words, even if he didn’t falsify anything in this case, if you think Donald Trump is a lying liarpants, you can still convict him because of his ‘general intent.” Is it any wonder that Trump was convicted on all 34 counts, on this basis?….\n",
      "\n",
      "2778. ….“Look, we would like to believe that the American justice system still has integrity. And in many states, perhaps it does. But clearly, not in New York. And ironically, the jury gave themselves away with their excessively and ridiculously consistent verdict. Had they found President Trump not guilty of even one tiny lesser offense, it would have been theoretically possible to believe that these jurors actually weighed the evidence. But guilty on all 34 counts? After only 2 days?….\n",
      "\n",
      "2779. “…No one ever said it would be easy to take America back from people who hate its foundational principles, and are willing to knife them not just for President Trump, but for anyone who has the audacity to support him. There is but one solace: such people may be able to temporarily force obeisance, but they have forever forfeited the right to respect. They may have power, but they have surrendered moral authority. They can make us pretend to take them seriously in public; they cannot stop us sniggering behind our hands. And we are. Because this is still a joke; a bad joke. A sinister joke. But a joke. And come November, we’re willing to bet, President Donald J. Trump will have the last laugh.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2780. Steven Calabresi: “President Donald Trump's Manhattan Convictions are Unconstitutional: Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg alleged that the documents were allegedly falsely altered to conceal a contribution of money in violation of federal campaign finance laws or in pursuance of winning the 2016 election by defrauding the voters of information they had a right to know. Neither argument passes First Amendment scrutiny. The federal campaign finance laws were partially upheld in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976)….\n",
      "\n",
      "2781. ….“In that case, campaign expenditure limits were ruled to be flatly unconstitutional as a violation of the First Amendment's protection of freedom of speech. Under Buckley v. Valeo, an individual like Donald Trump can spend an unlimited amount of his own money promoting his own campaign. But, the Supreme Court in Buckley did uphold contribution limits on how much an individual or a group could contribute to influence an election. Alvin Bragg argues that the Trump organization's contribution of $130,000 to pay Stormy Daniels hush money exceeded federal campaign finance limits on contributions. The federal government itself has adopted a policy of not prosecuting hush money payments as illegal campaign contributions in the wake of its embarrassing loss of such a prosecution brought against Democratic Vice Presidential contender John Edwards who had paid hush money to a mistress with who he had had a child out of wedlock….\n",
      "\n",
      "2782. ….“In 2010, in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, 558 U.S. 310, the Supreme Court held 5 to 4 that the freedom of speech clause of the First Amendment prohibits the government from restricting independent expenditures for political campaigns by closely allied corporations and groups like The Trump Organization. Under Citizens United, it was perfectly legal for The Trump Organization to pay Daniels $130,000 in hush money to conceal her alleged affair with Donald Trump….\n",
      "\n",
      "2783. .…“The opinion in Citizens United was written by former Justice, and liberal icon, Anthony M. Kennedy, and it was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Clarence Thomas, and Justice Samuel Alito all three of whom are still on the SC. Given the Court's current membership, it is highly likely that the outcome in Citizens Unitedwould prevail again today by a vote of 6 to 3. If Buckley v. Valeo was argued to be an obstacle to Trump prevailing, the SC would today, in 2024, and should today, in 2024, overrule the campaign finance contribution limits of federal election law as violations of the freedom of speech. Groups contributing to election campaigns can pay for advertising to promote candidates, and they can also pay hush money to keep bad or false stories out of the news. The effect either way is to help the candidate. You can contribute $ to generate good publicity.  And, you can contribute $ to avoid bad publicity.  The First Amendment protects freedom of speech in both cases….\n",
      "\n",
      "2784. ….“Campaign finance limits prevent speech by people who want to engage in it. They have changed Congress so badly that today Members of Congress spend 70% of their time raising money rather then legislating or meeting with their constituents because of absurdly low campaign finance limits that have not been adequately raised to match inflation since those laws were enacted in the 1970's.  The post-Watergate campaign finance laws were and always have been flagrantly unconstitutional in their totality….\n",
      "\n",
      "2785. ….“Federal Campaign Finance laws are an incumbent protection measure that makes it too hard for challengers to knock off incumbents who have much higher name id and who have franking privileges which allow them unlimited free correspondence with their constituents through the mail. That it is not to mention the power of incumbents to steer pork-barrel spending back to their own states and districts so that they will be endlessly re-elected….\n",
      "\n",
      "2786. ….“The First Amendment Freedom of Speech Clause also rules out of order Alvin Bragg's argument that Trump defrauded American voters by preventing them from hearing about Trump's affaire with Stormy Daniels. Theories as broad as this one is, of ‘defrauding voters’ would end up eliminating the freedom of speech in American elections…There was thus no predicate crime that Trump could have been concealing when he allegedly altered business records at The Trump Organization. Trump's convictions in the Manhattan trial are unconstitutional because they violate the First Amendment as it was originally understood….\n",
      "\n",
      "2787. ….“The U.S. Supreme Court needs to hear this case as soon as possible because of its impact on the 2024 presidential election between President Trump and President Biden. Voters need to know that the Constitution protected everything Trump is alleged to have done with respect to allegedly paying hush money to Stormy Daniels…The federal Supreme Court needs to make clear what are the legal rules in matters of great consequence to an election to a federal office like the presidency.  A highly partisan borough, Manhattan, of a highly partisan city, New York City, in a highly partisan state, like New York State, cannot be allowed to criminalize the conduct of presidential candidates in ways that violate the federal constitution. The Roman Republic fell when politicians began criminalizing politics. I am gravely worried that we are seeing that pattern repeat itself in the present-day United States. It is quite simply wrong to criminalize political differences.”\n",

Also, the #1 issue in this Country is not protecting democracy. It is INFLATION and IMMIGRATION! If it is protecting democracy, Trump is your best choice, because Crooked Joe Biden is the greatest threat to democracy in history with his Open Border and weaponization of our justice system against his political opponent, ME!

Anybody that’s not should be FIRED for incompetence! THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: “Corporate Tax Rate Spurs Political Battle: Biden wants to raise current rate to 28%, while some in GOP weigh a cut to 15%: WASHINGTON—The 21% U.S. corporate tax rate is the biggest single variable in the sprawling 2025 tax debate, and the two parties are trying to turn that dial in opposite directions with major consequences for companies’ profits and federal revenue. The rate could climb as high as 28% if Democrats sweep November’s elections and move as low as 15% if Republicans gain full power. President Biden’s plan for a 28% rate would reverse half of Republicans’ 2017 rate cut, pushing the U.S. corporate rate back near the highest among major economies. A 15% rate would match the lowest level since 1935, boosting profits and rewarding shareholders.”\n",

Trump and congressional Republicans got the rate down to 21%...Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.), who sits on the Senate Finance Committee, said Democrats should insist on higher corporate taxes as one of their red lines in the 2025 debate, even to the point of being willing to let the expiring tax cuts lapse. ‘Democrats don’t need to be suckers this time,’ she said Monday. ‘We can turn away from our history of bad dealmaking.’”)\n",

He didn’t even want to bring this “Zombie Case,” but when forced to attack me for Election Interference purposes, Bragg attempted to make it look as bad as possible by “stacking the counts” - A TOTAL SCAM. The reality is that the whole Hoax is just about Legal Expenses being paid and marked as….Legal Expenses. Instead, the Prosecutors made up 34 counts out of 11 Checks, 11 Invoices, and 12 Entries by a highly respected bookkeeper in a Ledger. Even the Invoices said, “Legal Retainer.” Why? Because that’s what it was, a payment to a then-fully accredited lawyer. Nothing illegal, no “conspiracies.” THE APPELLATE COURTS HAVE TO END THIS WITCH HUNT AGAINST A POLITICAL OPPONENT!\n",

      "\n",
      "3263. From the Great Victor Davis Hanson: “The five criminal and civil prosecutions of Donald Trump all prompt heated denials from Democrats that President Joe Biden and Dem operatives had a role in any of them. But Biden has long let it be known that he was frustrated with his own Department of Justice’s federal prosecutors for their tardiness in indicting Trump. Biden was upset because any delay might mean that his rival Trump would not be in federal court during the 2024 election cycle. And that would mean he could not be tagged as a ‘convicted felon’ by the November election while being kept off the campaign trail. Politico has long prided itself on its supposed insider knowledge of the workings of the Biden admin. Note that it was reported earlier this February that a frustrated Biden ‘has grumbled to aides and advisers that had Garland moved sooner in his investigation into former President Donald Trump’s election interference, a trial may already be underway or even have concluded.’\n",
      "\n",
      "3264. …Given Politico was reporting six months ago about Biden’s anger at the pace of his DOJ’s prosecution of Trump, does anyone believe his special counsel, Jack Smith, was not aware of such presidential displeasure and pressure? Note Smith had petitioned and was denied an unusual request to the court to speed up the course of his Trump indictment. And why would Biden’s own attorney general, Merrick Garland, select such an obvious partisan as Smith? Remember, in his last tenure as special counsel, Smith had previously gone after popular Republican and conservative Virginia Gov. Bob MacDonald. Yet Smith’s politicized persecution of the innocent McDonnell was reversed by a unanimous verdict of the U.S. Supreme Court. That rare court unanimity normally should have raised a red flag to the Biden DOJ about both Smith’s partiality and his incompetence…\n",
      "\n",
      "3265. …The White House’s involvement is not limited to the Smith federal indictments. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis’s paramour and erstwhile lead prosecutor in her indictment of Trump, Nathan Wade, met twice with the White House counsel’s office. On one occasion, Wade met inside the Biden White House. Subpoenaed records reveal that the brazen Wade actually billed the federal government for his time spent with the White House counsel’s staff — although so far no one has disclosed under oath the nature of such meetings. Of the tens of thousands of local prosecutions each year, in how many instances does a county prosecutor consult the White House counsel’s office — and then bill it for his knowledge? It is past time for the media and Democrats to drop this ridiculous ruse of Biden’s White House ‘neutrality.’ Instead, they should admit that they are terrified of the will of the people in November and so are conniving to silence them.”\n",

The Alvin Bragg trial was everything that Trump warns about…The charges were rigged, the prosecution’s presentation of the case was rigged, the judge’s management of the case was rigged, the gag order was rigged, and the instructions to the jury were rigged. The whole thing was rigged from beginning to end, in the hopes of — to the extent this case and the guilty verdict will matter in November — rigging the presidential election… their recklessness has further undermined faith in the system, while the alluring idea that there’s a shortcut to diminishing or defeating Trump has so far proved illusory.”\n",

      "3303. Elie Honig: “The Manhattan DA’s employees reportedly have called this the ‘Zombie Case’ because of various legal infirmities, including its bizarre charging mechanism. But it’s better characterized as the Frankenstein Case, cobbled together with ill-fitting parts into an ugly, awkward, but more-or-less functioning contraption that just might ultimately turn on its creator.”\n",

There is but one solace: such people may be able to temporarily force obeisance, but they have forever forfeited the right to respect. They may have power, but they have surrendered moral authority. They can make us pretend to take them seriously in public; they cannot stop us sniggering behind our hands. And we are. Because this is still a joke; a bad joke. A sinister joke. But a joke. And come November, we’re willing to bet, President Donald J. Trump will have the last laugh.”\n",

      "3306. Paul Ingrassia: “This was not a new case: it had been circulating in various court systems, federal and state, for years. These charges were only brought this year to interfere with the 2024 presidential race, period. President Trump is now the leading presidential candidate, by every reputable poll, and the frontrunner by significant margins, a gap that has only expanded over time. There is no reason why this case should be brought now, six months before Election Day, unless there was a conspiracy to prevent President Trump from being on the campaign trail in key swing states, like PA, MI, AZ, and GA, which is exactly what occurred.”\n",

Anderson, 601 U.S. 100 (2024), to remove one Presidential candidate from its ballot. Colorado purported to invoke a federal constitutional provision, but it was also a one-State effort to interfere with the Presidential election.

It was completely artificial. The Democrat prosecutors thought they were being so clever: tripping Trump up over this technicality – like collaring Al Capone for tax evasion, they probably told themselves. Except that everyone with any common sense can see what I consider their real motives, how they were combing the rule book for stuff to use against Trump.” “The vast mass of American voters could see what I believe was really happening: that the liberal elites were just appalled at Trump's continuing popularity and his ability to connect with voters – and they were using anything they could find to derail his campaign. That is why the anti-Trump lawfare is backfiring.”\n",

This is an indispensable feature of jury trials. It’s what defines our rule of law and makes America’s system of justice the envy of the world. But in the trial of Donald Trump, jurors can agree to disagree while still reaching the ultimate verdict in unanimity. Only in an ‘Alice in Wonderland’ case with a Mad Hatter judge could the cherished principles of fairness be turned upside down.”\n",
      "\n",
      "3489. Gregg Jarrett: “I dare say that in the history of American jurisprudence, never has a defendant been tried on an unidentified charge. No ethical prosecutor would ever do it. No fair or competent judge would ever allow it because every defendant has a right to be informed of the precise accusations against him. It is guaranteed in the Bill of Rights and rigorously guarded…The U.S. Supreme Court has held that unanimity in jury verdicts is required under the Sixth and Seventh Amendments. That requirement extends to all issues, said the high court. To find someone guilty, jurors must always agree —without dissent— on every necessary element of the purported crime. This is an indispensable feature of jury trials. Yet, it has inexplicably vanished in this case. District Attorney Alvin Bragg has deprived Trump of a fair trial by robbing him of his due process rights guaranteed under the Fourteenth Amendment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "3490. Gregg Jarrett: “The Sixth Amendment requires prosecutors to inform every defendant ‘of the nature and cause of the accusations’ against them. The deliberate refusal by the prosecution to do so in this case is an egregious violation of a hallowed constitutional right. Only in closing arguments —after the trial testimony concluded and all of the evidence was presented— did the prosecutor finally reveal the enigma: it was a federal election crime. But wait. He then contradicted himself by claiming that it was a state crime. Which is it? As a matter of law, neither. It can not be the former because a local prosecutor has no authority to enforce a federal law. And it can not be the latter, because it was a federal election, not a state contest. State law has no application.”\n",
      "\n",
      "3491. Gregg Jarrett: “The booking entries occurred in 2017, the year after the presidential contest ended. It’s factually impossible to influence an election when it is over. Regardless, there was no credible evidence that Trump had anything to do with the accounting methods or even knew about them. Why would he? He was the CEO, not the bookkeeper…Who exactly was defrauded? Voters who had already voted? The government which received full payment on all taxable income? The Federal Election Commission (FEC) that concluded the money paid did not constitute a campaign donation under law? Prosecutors never actually disclosed the lynchpin of their case during the trial because they could not. There was no fraud and no conspiracy. It is that simple. Moreover, without a primary crime, there can be no secondary crime… It is classic ‘lawfare’ —weaponizing statutes not because the law has been broken but because the accused poses a political threat.”\n",

When you compare the way he is, and that kind of energy to what is in the White House now, it’s persuasive. I mean, you look at this guy, and you go, ‘I get it, that guy’s pissed off, and he’s clear.’ Meanwhile, this guy speaks in these amorphous fantasies about ‘a threat to Democracy.’ He can’t solve anything. He doesn’t know what’s going on, and this guy is fighting for his life. I mean, it’s a pretty stark choice for Americans if they‘re paying attention to this, but maybe most of them, they’re tuned out, because they know this is all B.S.”\n",

The falsification of business records; and3. Tax violationsOf course, the issue for all of the above is the requirement of a criminal intent.Furthermore, the idea that jurors can pick 1 of the 3, and they don't have to unanimously agree on which of the three, is another shocking development.Moreover, the federal campaign violation has still not been defined.\n",

This Judge, whose conflicts are completely disqualifying, isn’t even requiring a unanimous decision by the jury on key portions of this Criminal Hoax, which is UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND UNAMERICAN. The whole Case should be ENDED IMMEDIATELY, and all the charges THROWN OUT, because everything was done right, with Legal Expenses being reported as Legal Expenses! The Judge CANNOT be allowed to do further damage to Justice in New York and our Nation, and every Legal Scholar and Expert agrees with this. The whole Sham is a disgusting Political Witch Hunt by Crooked Joe Biden’s White House. ELECTION INTERFERENCE!\n",
